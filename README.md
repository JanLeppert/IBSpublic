# IBS

This code base is using the Julia Language and [DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> IBS

It is authored by Jan Leppert.

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.

## Project discription

This project is supplementary material to the paper "Simulation of ideal basic separations in gas chromatography with negative temperature gradients" by Jan Leppert, Leonid M. Blumberg, Matthias WÃ¼st and Peter Boeker.

This github project includes a mybinder notebook with a version of the simulation.
